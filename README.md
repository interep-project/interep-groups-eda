# Interep Groups Exploratory Data Analysis

## Data

Public user profiles on the Interep supported provider platforms (currently GitHub, Reddit, Twitter)

## Objectives

1. Collect a data sample of reasonable size: between 100-1000 public user profiles for each provider
2. Evaluate the current shape of the reputation distribution for each provider/
3. Define appropriate level thresholds so that the distribution is skewed from `undefined` to `gold`
   Indeed common sense tells that there should be a lot of `undefined` or `bronze`, some `silver` but just a few `gold`.

## Getting started

1. Define your config settings in `.config.yaml`  
   For twitter you'll need to get a bearer token from https://developer.twitter.com/en
2. `npm add -g pnpm`
3. `pnpm i`
4. `nps "start <sample-size>"`
5. Sample is stored in `twitter.json`
