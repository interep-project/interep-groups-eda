# Interep Groups Exploratory Data Analysis

## Data

Public user profiles on the Interep supported provider platforms (currently GitHub, Reddit, Twitter)

## Objectives

1. Collect a data sample of reasonable size: between 100-1000 public user profiles for each provider
2. Evaluate the current shape of the reputation distribution for each provider/
3. Define appropriate level thresholds so that the distribution is skewed from `undefined` to `gold`
   Indeed common sense tells that there should be a lot of `undefined` or `bronze`, some `silver` but just a few `gold`.
